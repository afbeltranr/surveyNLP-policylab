## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/afbeltranr/surveyNLP-policylab.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run pipeline
python main.py
```

## üìà Results

Key topics identified from the survey responses:

1. üè• **Healthcare Access**
   - Mental health services are underserved (Topic 13)
   - Limited access to medical facilities (Topic 14)
   - Essential medication shortages (Topic 2)
   - Long appointment wait times (Topic 4)

2. üèó **Infrastructure Issues**
   - Frequent power outages (Topic 10)
   - Limited access to clean water (Topic 12)
   - Poor waste management (Topic 11)
   - Housing conditions need improvement (Topic 7)

3. üíº **Economic Challenges**
   - Limited local employment opportunities (Topic 0)
   - Youth migration due to lack of opportunities (Topic 5)
   - Insufficient support for entrepreneurship (Topic 6)

4. ü§ù **Social Cohesion**
   - Low community participation (Topic 1)
   - Feelings of abandonment (Topic 3)
   - Lack of trust in institutions (Topic 9)

These insights suggest a need for:
- Improved healthcare infrastructure and access
- Infrastructure maintenance and development
- Economic development initiatives
- Community engagement programs üá®üá¥  
> Modular & Continuously Delivered NLP System for Qualitative Survey Analysis

This project simulates an automated NLP system that processes and summarizes qualitative territorial survey responses to support human-centered policy development. It emphasizes **flexible automation**, **human-in-the-loop validation**, and **modular CI/CD**, powered by **synthetic data** and scalable Python code.

## üöß Project Stages

> Each stage will include visuals and automation scripts. Status will update as we go!

### ‚úÖ Stage 1: Corpus Creation & Taxonomy Design  
![Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in_progress-yellow)
- Generate synthetic survey responses across diverse regions and groups
- Build initial taxonomic categories based on public policy themes  
<-- explain how categories and subcategories were selected from real-world policies -->

---

### ‚úÖ Stage 2: Topic Modeling & Representation Learning  
![Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-not_started-lightgrey)
- Use BERTopic, UMAP + HDBSCAN
- Embed TabM-style representation adapters (optional innovation layer)  
<-- explain adapter ensemble idea and why it's innovative for tabular NLP -->

---

### ‚úÖ Stage 3: LLM-assisted Classification  
![Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-not_started-lightgrey)
- GPT-based codification using few-shot prompts
- Validate vs. manual labels (simulation of expert input)  
<-- explain the importance of classification assist for edge cases -->

---

### ‚úÖ Stage 4: Dashboards & Policy Narratives  
![Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-not_started-lightgrey)
- Generate visuals by region, population group, and topic
- Summarize with quote banks and key insights  
<-- describe impact: how these visuals help decision makers -->

---

### ‚úÖ Stage 5: CI/CD for Continuous Learning  
![Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-not_started-lightgrey)
- GitHub Actions run tests + retrain model weekly or on new data
- Output updated reports + flag shifts in discourse  
<-- show automation diagram, link YAML workflow, explain Bayesian retraining metaphor -->
