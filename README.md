# NLP-Driven Territorial Insight Pipeline 🇨🇴  
> Modular & Continuously Delivered NLP System for Qualitative Survey Analysis

This project simulates an automated NLP system that processes and summarizes qualitative territorial survey responses to support human-centered policy development. It emphasizes **flexible automation**, **human-in-the-loop validation**, and **modular CI/CD**, powered by **synthetic data** and scalable Python code.

### 📌 Key Features
- ✅ End-to-end ETL pipeline with continuous retraining
- 🧠 Topic modeling, clustering, and LLM-assisted classification
- ⚙️ TabM-style adapter ensemble experimentation
- 📊 Visual dashboards + policy-ready narratives
- 🔄 CI/CD with GitHub Actions (Bayesian-style update loop)

## 🚧 Project Stages

> Each stage will include visuals and automation scripts. Status will update as we go!

### ✅ Stage 1: Corpus Creation & Taxonomy Design  
![Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in_progress-yellow)
- Generate synthetic survey responses across diverse regions and groups
- Build initial taxonomic categories based on public policy themes  
<-- explain how categories and subcategories were selected from real-world policies -->

---

### ✅ Stage 2: Topic Modeling & Representation Learning  
![Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-not_started-lightgrey)
- Use BERTopic, UMAP + HDBSCAN
- Embed TabM-style representation adapters (optional innovation layer)  
<-- explain adapter ensemble idea and why it's innovative for tabular NLP -->

---

### ✅ Stage 3: LLM-assisted Classification  
![Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-not_started-lightgrey)
- GPT-based codification using few-shot prompts
- Validate vs. manual labels (simulation of expert input)  
<-- explain the importance of classification assist for edge cases -->

---

### ✅ Stage 4: Dashboards & Policy Narratives  
![Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-not_started-lightgrey)
- Generate visuals by region, population group, and topic
- Summarize with quote banks and key insights  
<-- describe impact: how these visuals help decision makers -->

---

### ✅ Stage 5: CI/CD for Continuous Learning  
![Stage](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-not_started-lightgrey)
- GitHub Actions run tests + retrain model weekly or on new data
- Output updated reports + flag shifts in discourse  
<-- show automation diagram, link YAML workflow, explain Bayesian retraining metaphor -->

## 🧠 Why This Project Matters

This simulation reflects real-world NLP applications in public services, especially where **qualitative understanding** matters more than raw numbers. It merges **data science, automation, and social context**, preparing analysts to think beyond dashboards.
